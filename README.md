This is a simple e-commerce website implemented using Spring Boot. It allows customers to browse products, add them to a basket, and simulate orders. Additionally, admin users have privileges to manage products on the site.

## Features

- **Product Browsing**: Customers can view available products on the website.
- **Basket Management**: Customers can add products to their basket and proceed to checkout.
- **Order Simulation**: Customers can simulate placing an order.
- **Admin Privileges**: Admin users can add, modify, and delete products from the site.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: For building the web application.
- **Thymeleaf**: For server-side rendering of HTML templates.
- **Spring Security**: For managing user authentication and authorization.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For database interaction.
- **MySQL (or any preferred database)**: For storing product and user information.


## Usage

- **Customer**: Browse products, add items to basket, and simulate orders.
- **Admin**: Manage products by adding, modifying, or deleting them.



## Note

While this application may be very simple, the primary idea is to apply the principles and techniques learned from Spring Boot. It serves as a foundational project to understand concepts such as MVC architecture, security, data persistence, and more within the Spring framework.


## Acknowledgments
